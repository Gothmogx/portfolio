The idle tycoon game self published by [Friends Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/friends-games-incubator/). It didn't get deserved success unfortunately but it was fun to work on.
The game was developed using Unity ECS framework which helped to achieve good performance on mobiles. I contributed to develpment of several features, adding effects and UI interactions and optimizing. Also I was involved in experiments of moving the project from 2d to 3d. It was exciting but never reached the store.
